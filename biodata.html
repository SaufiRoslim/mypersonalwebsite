    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; background-color: #3D0C02; font-style:oblique; color: aliceblue; font-size: 18px;">My name is Muhammad Saufi Bin Roslim and my nickname is Copey. On 24<sup>th</sup>May 2001, I was born in Hospital Tuanku Jaafar, Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. I am 20 years old and study at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara" >UiTM</abbr> Rembau Negeri Sembilan. I have five siblings, I am the oldest of my siblings in the family. From the time I was born until now, I have lived in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan. I'm a happy person who enjoys conversing with people who share my interests. I appreciate the simplicity and am not one to procrastinate on tasks.  I am easily demotivated, but I will do everything in my power to overcome that tendency. It's because, in order to live a happier and more productive life, I need to overcome all of my negative characteristics. My father, Roslim Bin Othman, is from Perak, and he married Wan Fatimah Nor Binti Abu Bakar, also from Perak. After they married, they settled in Nilai, my father working as a lorry driver in Subang and my mother not working. They lived happily ever after after I was born. Furthermore, I enjoy watching anime at home in my spare time. I have a large collection of CDs that I never tyre of listening to. I started reading comic books when I was ten years old, and I adore anime. I enjoy watching all kinds of anime, but my favourite is anime. A studio in my home is something I'd like to have. I intend to save money in order to construct a home mini-cinema.I'm living my life, and I'm grateful to God for allowing me to exist in this world. I am grateful to God for always providing me with convenience in everything I do. My current family and close friends are enough for me. Despite the fact that I only have a few close friends, I am grateful and happy to have them. I hope they share my sentiments. I'm now giving it my all in everything I do. Since I am still in university, I want to achieve excellent results so that I and my family can be proud of me. I'll also put in a lot of effort to finish my studies and find a job that I enjoy..</p>
